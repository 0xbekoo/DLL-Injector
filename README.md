<p>
   Welcome to my simple DLL Injection Project written in C! This project injects a DLL into any running Process. <br/>
   When a DLL is injected into the program, a message called DLL Injected is printed on the screen.
</p> <br/>

<h2> Running Program </h2>
<p>
  Before running the program, copy the dll file in the dll_file file to the C: location. <br/>
  Then compile the cpp project: 
</p> <br/>
```console
foo@bar:~$ whoami
foo
```
